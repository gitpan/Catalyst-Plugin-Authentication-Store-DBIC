Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication::Store::DBIC

0.05    2006-03-02 20:36:00
        - make role_class and user_class auto-vivify to corresponding DBIC 
          resultset when possible
        - allow direct access to DBIC object columns via $c->user->column
          (the object itself is $c->user->obj) and deprecated old ways to get object
	- fix test suite -- should now pass, and hopefully not fail just because
          don't have some modules, such as Class::DBI or Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema
	- rename real_user_class to catalyst_user_class
	- use recordsets rather than depend on list context
	- return undef rather than complain when password is called without user
